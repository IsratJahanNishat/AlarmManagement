# AlarmManagement

Wear OS is a version of Google's Android operating system designed for smartwatches and other wearables.
The Wear OS by Google app, previously Android Wear, syncs your smartwatch and phone so you can get more out of your watch.
Get proactive help from your Google Assistant, see important messages, track health and fitness, and more, all from your wrist.


Different types of use cases/attractive features where developer can use
AlarmManager API on their Wear OS application can be explained.

Alarms (based on the AlarmManager class) give a way to perform time-based operations outside the lifetime of any application. For example, you could use an alarm to initiate a long-running operation, such as starting a service once a day to download a weather forecast.

Alarms have these characteristics:

They let you fire Intents at set times and/or intervals.

You can use them in conjunction with broadcast receivers to schedule jobs or WorkRequests to perform other operations.

They operate outside of your application, so you can use them to trigger events or actions even when your app is not running, and even if the device itself is asleep.

They help you minimize your app's resource requirements. You can schedule operations without relying on timers or continuously running services.

AlarmManager API on Wear OS can be the best reminder for any developer to remind them about their project submission time. Sometimes developers provide unrealistic estimates for projects. Unfortunately, they believe that they can complete it sooner than it should take. The reason can be a genuine estimation error, overconfidence, or being too optimistic. The results are work pressure, a decline in efficiency, and errors, which cause the extension of deadlines.: Wear OS developers require to use alarm manager to schedule any task to run at a specific time in the future. As example, app can get sensorâ€™s data at a specific time or start a service to call an
API.So, AlarmManager API will be a great solution for all these puzzle.


The Alarm Manager is intended for cases where you want to have your application
code run at a specific time, even if your application is not currently running. For normal timing operations (ticks, timeouts, etc) 
it is easier and much more efficient to use Handler.

Considering Task 1 as an example we can see the attractive features of AlarmManager API. In task1 accelerometer sensor can be used, accelerometer sensor is a tool that measures the acceleration of any body or object in its instantaneous rest frame. It is not a coordinate acceleration. Accelerometer sensors are used in many ways, such as in many electronic devices, smartphones, and wearable devices, etc. Accelerometers are used in biomedical applications, and biomedical field accelerometer sensors are mainly operated in step counting, activity monitoring, or motion artwork and suppression. Accelerometer sensors are easy to apply to all subjects, without much emphasis on sensor placement. These sensors are used to monitor vital signals, even for the problematic cases surrounding cardiac arrest.

In Android, you can use the alarm manager to trigger events. These events can be at a specific time or at regular intervals. We will start the chapter with the basics of the alarm manager where we set a simple alarm. We will then cover setting an alarm that repeats, cancelling an alarm, the role of pending intents (specifically the role their uniqueness plays), and setting multiple alarms. By the end of the chapter, you will have learned both the basics and the practical nitty-gritty of the Android alarm manager.
